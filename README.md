## Create Gui objects in Nodes for a Tree

Trying to make creating a simple gui very quick and easy to understand in terms of containers and widgets.

It is important that the code in some way resemble the screen for easy recognition of gui structure. The main code should be easy to read.

Initially the containers are frames, but 'virtual boxes' will be added that are not a gui widget.

See 'project_description.txt' for a sample and simple application and explanation


I prefer code to be easy to understand rather than efficient, hence the tree traversal code. I have avoided using recursion for the same reason and also for the easier ability to exit at a known point. Recursion was used in earlier attempts.
