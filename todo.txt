Need to add back features to table, editing a cell for example, sorting on a column

With the amcat software (amcat_main.py) I would like to move the pop-up window just right of the button
Also, if the pop-up window is closed other than by pressing the button, it need to set the status to None
  easy to stop it closing the window using .protocol("WM_DELETE_WINDOW", self.close_stage)
  This removes the options from the window self.children[stage].root.overrideredirect(1)
  See code for solution





# Test right align
# Do vertical containers
# Add a top and right attribute
# Add other widgets
# Inorporate the creation into the classes - specific to the widget type
# Add commands for buttons etc.
# Drill down the build
# Detect errors, missing widths and heights, container too small
# Handle fixed size containers
# Provide variables for text and entry widgets
# Do we insist each container is a widget and hence the children start from the 0,0 of the box
  or do we allow virtual boxes that are not widgets (as a canvas would behave if it had box children)

Note the container attributes left, right, top, bottom are used only if there are no args
(i.e. a row does not use left and right, they are assumed to be in the arguments
      a column container does not use top and bottom for the same reason)
